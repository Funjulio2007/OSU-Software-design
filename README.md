To run the game, download the SDP Simulator file and open it in Visual Studio Code. Inside the file are all needed components to run it except for git and mingw installer. Those need to be installed separately. 
After opening the file with VS Code, open the main.cpp program to see the code and type mingw32-make to build it and ./game.exe to run it
